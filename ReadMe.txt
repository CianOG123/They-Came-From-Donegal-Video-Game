                                                       ------ PREMISE ------

 This game is the result of an inside joke between a friend of mine and I. I promised her I would put her 
 face inside a game of Space Invaders after I had made a rough Space Invader style game as an assignment for University.
 As a result of quarantine, boredom, and my own weakness (that is to focus too much on small details), the silly idea eventually
 morphed into a full game. Originally I had plans for the game to include a boss battle, level music, different backgrounds,
 etc. However, there came a point where I had to step away from the keyboard as the project was quickly growing too laborious
 for my liking, and by this stage the project had also fulfilled its ultimate purpose; to improve my programming abilities,
 and to fulfill a promise I had made to a good friend. Any further development would have been trivial, barely improved my coding 
 abilities, the joke was also growing stale for me at this stage in development and I was growing sick of watching these little 
 aliens move across the screen. So, here's the finished product, warts and all.     

 I hope everyone of you enjoys this game (Even if that means laughing at my terrible code I promise I'll use more setters and 
 getters in the future haha.), and thanks for taking the time to read my spiel everybody!

 health.

                                                   ---- WEAPON DESCRIPTION ----

• Press the 'A' key to fire a standard bullet. The player is given an infinite supply of these bullets, 
  the bullet will despawn once it hits and alien and will deal 1 point of damage.

• If you have picked up a power-up from a Pirate Alien, you can press the 'S' key to fire a Cannon-Ball, 
  the cannonball will destroy every alien it touches and drops from the top of the screen.

• If you have picked up a power-up from  a Rainbow Alien, you can press the 'S' key to fire a Rainbow-Dash, this power-up will
  wipe out every alien it touches.

• If you have picked up a power-up from  a Robot Alien, you can press the 'Z' key to fire a Laser-Ray, this power-up will
  kill every alien in the same row and column as the original alien that is hit.

• If you have picked up a power up from a Space Alien, you can press the 'XX key to fire a Plasma-Bomb, this power-up will deal
  damage to every alien in proximity to the alien that is hit.


                                                     ---- KNOWN GLITCHES ----
• There is an audio glitch that occurs when the game is played for too long, this occurs as a result of overloading the amount of 
  tracks supplied by the audio library in processing, causing pulse like audio to occur. I do not have the time nor care to fix
  this issue.

• Image resize issues will occur, for users who are not using screens that are 1920 x 1080. There is an image resize function in main.
  If anyone cares enough feel free to implement it.
